<h1 align="center">Simple Weather Responsive Website Project</h1>


This is a website for an organisation called "Simple Weather". Simple Weather's vision is to make finding out the current weather forecast and the forecast for the following days as easy as possible. 
Their goal is to provide a simplistic, navigable website by removing any graphs, charts and other confusing information that the average user struggles to comprehend and replacing it with simple and 
easily understandable information that is friendly to all types of users.

The website has 1 main page. Upon entering the site, the user is greeted with a very simple but warm design and is automatically given the opportunity to enter a location to find out the forecast for the coming days.
